Whisper requires the following files to run:
ggml.c
ggml.h
ggml-base.en.bin (other models can be subbed in)

These files are either too large or depend on something too large to
put in the repo.  You can get them from:
https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp

Once you have cloned the repo, copy those files to THIS directory:
/PersonalAssistant/modules/core/whisper

The files may also be hosted somewhere by me, if so they can be found here:
